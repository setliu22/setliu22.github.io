        <h2>Hi! I'm Seton (see â€¢ tn, like the college Seton Hall). I'm a recently
            graduated high school senior who is taking a gap year before entering college
            as a member of the MIT class of 2027.

    books: Mathematics for Machine Learning

    I used the art of problem solving Alcumus answering 146 problems correct out of 
    183 over the span of 17 days (~80%). Just to re-train my basic problem solving skills

    During this time, I developed my website

    <h1>
        This site serves to track my progress as a self-taught programmer. piqued my interest
        in computer science. Hopefully it serves as a guide and motivator to other
        students interested in teaching tmeselves computer science (for free!).
    </h1>

    I like to use these cheatsheets as references for syntax, but the best way to learn a
    language is to do projects.
